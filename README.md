How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

_I feel that both static and dynamic testing are very useful that all is functional and secure. 
Using JUnit testing to make sure that all the requirements are being met is very great at doing this._

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

_I interpret a user needs by talking to them one on one to go over certain requirments they may want or need. 
While writing the program I use the requirments given and incorprate them, constantly referring back to the requirments as I move along.
I would refer back to the user to make sure none of the requirements need changed or new ones need added. _

How do I approach designing software?

_While designing software I try to test early and often to help prevent any problems that may occur later down the line.
